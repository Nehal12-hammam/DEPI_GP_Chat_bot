Promotional Video Generation Telegram Bot Project Description This project is a Telegram bot designed to help users create promotional videos based on product descriptions. The bot interacts with users conversationally, gathering product details step-by-step, and generating a video highlighting the product's key features. The video is created using a combination of Visual Transformers image generation techniques and background music for a professional presentation.

The bot allows users to: Provide product details through a series of guided questions. Receive a summarized product description. Generate a promotional video based on the description. Search within video transcriptions using keywords.

Key Features: Conversational Interface: The bot guides users through product description collection. Video Generation: Automated video creation based on user-provided product information. Search Functionality: Users can search for specific details within video transcriptions. Unrelated Function Detection: Future functionality to detect unrelated or extraneous functions.

Future Enhancements: Implement advanced search capabilities. Introduce additional media options, including audio and image variations. Detect unrelated or redundant functions for improved accuracy and relevance.
Technologies: Telegram API for bot interaction. Visual Transformers for image generation. Python for backend development. LangChain for search and language processing. Gradio for interface. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jm-bezoVB0HFg6IKFe5VRPj6-GsZhTNU?usp=sharing
